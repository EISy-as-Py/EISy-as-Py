First Try Dot Py

This .py to capture all of the Google Drive API integration Information and Examples that I am working towards
"First Try" is hopefully going to be a quick project so I can share with the group. 
NOTE LINK:
https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python


With a bit more time, I might make some SETUP functions and config files to make it even easier, and/or incorporate the import files in this folder.
